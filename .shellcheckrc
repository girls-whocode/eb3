#

# SC2128 - Expanding an array without an index only gives the first element.

#   Currently there are vars that are referenced for future implimentation
#   disabling this for now.

# SC1090 - Can't follow non-constant source. Use a directive to specify location.
#   This application requires the use of variables to define the location for
#   installed files. ShellCheck cannot determine what directory the variable
#   points to.

# SC1091 - Not following: (error message here)
#   This application requires the use of variables to define the loaction for
#   the sourced files. ShellCheck cannot determine what directory the variable
#   points to.

# SC2181 - Check exit code directly with e.g. if mycmd;, not indirectly with $?.
#   

# SC2015 - A && B || C is not if-then-else. C may run when A is true.
#   C needs to run if A or B is true, this is a false positive
